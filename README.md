# Recursive_Array_Sum
The program defines a recursive function total that takes an array and its size as arguments and returns the sum of all elements in the array. The base case for the recursion is when the size of the array is 0, at which point the function returns 0. Otherwise, it adds the last element of the array to the sum of the remaining elements.
